About myself:
I know exactly where I am going and striving for, and working in an IT company is one of the stages of my conscious and purposeful path. I am interested in continuous, lasting self-development. I approach the organization of my daily activities responsibly. I am interested in the development of AI - technologies, automatization and getting rid of routine work for humanity.
I apply the scientific method in my daily life and steadily expand my horizons. I am interested in the general theory of evaluation and rely on facts, not empty words.
